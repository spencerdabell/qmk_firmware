diode direction:
col2row or row2col

col2row is the typical setup for large keyboards, because the scanning needs a lot of ports?
why isn't it 

lets just do col2row since thats typical

wont the scanning be more precise if its the other way?

(depending on the wiring)
333333 or 33444

row2col would be
vs 666
seems 2x as fast


looks like corrugated flyaway is col2row

lets do row2col for this new build, which i think allows just the diodes to orient the other way
